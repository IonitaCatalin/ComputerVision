**1bp** 1)Using the Sobel operator described and the generic convolution (week 2) operation, plot the filter response for a grayscale transformed RGB image.

**1bp** 2)Using the eigenfilter defined for the last exercise, analyze the filter response with respect to increasing the patch size. Relate the behaviour to the covariance matrix magnitude.

**2bp** 3)Using the definition for the eigenfilter defined in this exercise, replace the local patch approach by a k-nearest neighbors approach. Analyze the response of the filter and describe the difference to the response of the local patch approach. Discuss the behavior of the filter when increasing the number of neighbors.

**1bp** 4)Use the local patch eigenfilter approach as feature extractor for the SVC classifier. Compare the missclassification rate to the one produced by the same model with features defined as the Local Binary Pattern histogram.
