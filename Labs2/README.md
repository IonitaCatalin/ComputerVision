**1bp** ✔️ 1. Using the wand.image Python package, simulate other mechanisms for distorsion (For example, the Barrel distortion, as described in the next image).

**1bp** ✔️ 2. Using OpenCV documentation, deploy the OpenCV camera calibration tool on the given checkerboard image. Bonus (another 1bp): Experiment with your own camera and a printed calibration pattern.

**1bp** ✔️ 3. Experiment with Direct Linear Transform starting from another set of input points. Project all the real domain square corners in the calibration pattern provided.

**1bp** ✔️ 4. Analytically compute the mean and the variance for the data normalized by the T and U matrices
